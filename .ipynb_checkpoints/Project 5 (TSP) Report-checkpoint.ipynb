    "It looks like the cost of tour, running time, max number of stored states, number of states created, and number of states pruned all generally grow with problem size, but they don't grow strictly. For example, there were more states pruned with 17 cities than with 18. This most likely is due to varying graphs in hard mode, and also varying effectiveness of the greedy algorithm. For some graphs, the greedy will give an extremely good estimate, increasing the pruned states and, hence, minimize the number of states created. For others, the greedy will give an estimate that is farther off from the true optimal solution.\n",
